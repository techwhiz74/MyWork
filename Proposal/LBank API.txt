I just want Lbank API specialist
It's just balancing with DEX platform.
It's only for tonk/usdt.
After comparing the price of tonk/usdt between LBank and other DEX platform like stonfi.
If there is difference, you have to match the price of LBank by buying or selling.
First you have to make Lbank API part to buy or sell any amount.
After completing project


You have to test it
Whether Lbank API is working or not
You can check if any amount is working or not
