8. What in your opinion is the most important quality in a full stack developer?

In my opinion, the most important quality in a full stack developer is the ability to learn and adapt quickly. 

Technologies and programming languages are constantly evolving, and it's important to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and tools. 

Another important quality is the ability to work collaboratively with other team members and communicate effectively to ensure everyone is on the same page. 

Finally, attention to detail and a passion for creating clean, efficient code is also crucial for success as a full stack developer.

9. What is the most essential programming language for your job? 

As a full-stack developer, I believe that it's important to have a good understanding of multiple programming languages. 

However, the most essential language would depend on the specific project and its requirements.

I am proficient in multiple languages such as Java, React, JavaScript, and PHP, and I am always willing to learn and adapt to new technologies.


10. From the JDs in which areas or tasks do you think you would need more support on and which ones would be easy for you to deliver?

In terms of areas where I might need more support, I would say that any technology or tool that is particularly new or unfamiliar to me would require some extra effort and guidance to get up to speed.

 On the other hand, tasks that involve problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity are areas where I feel confident and comfortable delivering high-quality work.

 However, I'm always willing to learn and adapt to new challenges, and I believe that with the right support and resources, I can tackle any task successfully.
