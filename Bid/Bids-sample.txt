I am a blockchain engineer who has deep knowledge of Rust, Terra, Go, Cosmwasm, solidity, Web3.js, and terra.js, and I have much experience in Defi-related projects. So it makes me a strong candidate for your job. 
I can design/develop/test/deploy the smart contracts with solidity and truffle or hardhat. I have much experience in Terra, and as you probably know the both Terra and Solana is written by Rust.
So writing the smart contracts using the solana is my easy working. The last time, I've worked on similar projects and that's why I am willing to show you some of my projects via private chat. You can check my last project here:

I've read your job posting carefully and I found your proposal is very fit to my past experience. 
This NFT mint site is I wrote using the Solana metaplex candy machine.
 https://luckylemurs.com/test 
 
 
- Generate 10k unique NFTs with rarity and traits : 3 days 
- Develop Solana NFT smart contract (needs to connect with secondary markets like Solanart etc) : 1 day 
- Connect our website to Solana wallets using Web3 so collectors can mint the NFT on our website : 1 day 
- Support us in sending out the NFTs after minting completed : 6 months (one month is free working the remained 5 month is contracted working with part time) 
 
I am looking forward to you and talk in more detail soon!
